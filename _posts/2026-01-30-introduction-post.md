## What parts were new to you?

This is my first time ever forking a repository. I believe this copies the main repository without interfering with the main author's branch. Now, I have this new repository on my local computer, and I can benefit from the layouts without having to make them myself. Also, I am not familiar with Ruby, and this was my first time downloading it.

## What parts did you struggle with?

[Downloading Ruby][ruby-link] was a bit troublesome, especially since my computer did not like the files that I was downloading. My computer kept giving me warnings about how the download file for the windows installer was not commonly downloaded, and it concerned me. However, here I am, writing up my first blog with no problems.

## What parts still do not make sense?

I am confused as to how Ruby/Jekyll is working within this project under the hood. I believe that Jekyll is what gives us the nice layout of the website; however, I am not sure how it is exactly functioning.

## What are you looking forward to?

I am looking forward to:

- learning and using [Jekyll][jekyll-link]
- strengthening my skills with Bootstrap
- refreshing my knowledge about manipulating data
- and finding ways to make things on a website animated with CSS
