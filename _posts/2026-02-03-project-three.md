## What parts were new to you?

I was new to using the ordered lists with Jekyll and putting font links into the head.html file. It was also new for me to create a brand new page.

## What parts did you struggle with?

I struggled with getting the font links into the head.html page, as I was not sure where it was located. After a little bit of searching and with some help, I was able to link a font that I liked! I also struggled with simply making all of the text to one font.

## What parts still do not make sense?

I tried using "text{}" in the css file to make changes to all types of text (h1, h2, p, etc), but it didn't work. I wonder if there is another method that will allow me to make changes to everything so I do not have to copy and paste the same font styles to each type of text.

## What are you looking forward to?

I am looking forward to developing my CSS skills/knowledge. I want to learn how to make things animated. Something like making borders move when you hover over a button. I am also looking forward to learning more about Jekyll's layout and how it constructs these html files from the markdown files.

## More Music!

Below are some of the albums from my Music page. The images below match the theme of each album, and you can click these images, which takes you to each of their spotify links!
